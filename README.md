# Amazon Data Science Project
Data science analysis project on Amazon consumer reviews.

## Obtaining Data Sets
We used two data sets in this project obtained from open-source database sites:
1. A set on baby products obtained from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ (161k)
2. A larger set on Amazon electronic phone products from https://data.world/promptcloud/amazon-mobile-phone-reviews (400k+)

## Cleaning the Data Sets
This project is based off analyzing word trends in consumer reviews based off the star(1-5) review the consumer provided
We stripped the data of all categories except: *review text*, *review rating*, and *review helpful cotes*
